Liquiteria

- website makes use of bright colors, appetizing presentation
- not categorized by end-user's purpose
- lacking specifics about ingredients - why is this ingredient used as opposed to another?

Organic Avenue

- simple and clean website, not flashy but not dull
- not very personalized
- i have no idea who they are trying to target

Blue Print Cleanse

- exclusively for juice fast/cleanse dieters, so the website only targets that audience
- offers more information - newsletters for example
- very simple website

*Nobody is asking about information about what the client is looking for?
